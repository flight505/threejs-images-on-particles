A project that projects images on particles. These include:

	•	Custom Geometry
	•	Points (particles)
	•	Grid of particles
	•	Custom ShaderMaterial (GLSL)
	•	Texture + UVs

This repository will help you start with images on particles in 3D environments using Three.js, a powerful WebGL library. It is powered by Vite ⚡️, which compiles everything quickly. The project also includes support for Sass, Babel, ESLint, Prettier, lil-gui, and GSAP for animations.

It includes a LoaderManager.js file to easily load assets (images, textures, 3D models, etc.) in a single function.

# Vite template builder to quickly generate Threejs code in the browser.

This repository will help creating 3D environment using [Threejs](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_keyframes), a powerful WebGL library. It is powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) ⚡️ that quickly compiles anything you need, it is also including [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [lil-gui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lil-gui) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/docs/) for animations.

It is also including a LoaderManager JS file to easily load your assets: (Image, Textures, 3D models...) in one function.
